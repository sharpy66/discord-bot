We will not provide support for issues found only in this version. If you believe youâ€™ve found a bug, please retest on our Nightly builds. Both versions are still in development, so expect crashes and bugs."},

After launching your game, go to `Emulation > Configure Current Game > Cheats tab`\n\nSelect **Add Cheat**, enter the name of your cheat code and the cheat code itself into the relevant boxes, and select **Save**. To enable the cheat code, tick the box next to the name of the cheat code in the `Available Cheats` list.\n\n**Android**\nLaunch your game, then press the Back button to open Citra's in-game menu, and select the `Open Cheats` option. Select the `+` button on the bottom right, then enter the name of your cheat code and the cheat code itself into the relevant boxes.

If you require extdata too, not all games do, press X then press L.\n\nThese will be dumped to /3ds/Checkpoint/saves then either saves or extdata.\n\nLaunch Citra and make sure your game directory is listed on the main screen so the game shows up there. Right click on the game you want then choose Open Save Data Location or Open Extra Data Location. Make sure to launch the game at least once in Citra to create these folders first. \n\nOnce those have been open, just replace any save files in Citra with the ones dumped from your 3DS.\n<https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint>\nTo reverse this and put a Citra save on the 3DS, work backwards and use R to restore it."},
      "states": {"reply": "Save states save the entirety of Citra's emulation state. As a result of this, Citra updates that add new things to serialize in the emulation state will break the loading of existing save states that were created on prior Citra versions. Additionally, saving upon save state created progress will make the emulation state gradually more unstable, since the emulation state never gets to clear out emulation bugs with a proper shut down.\nThis is why in-game save files should be used most of all when saving and loading your progress. Save states should only be used within single gaming sessions, not beyond them.\nLastly, save states cannot be transferred between different Citra installations. They may load, but they'll break the virtual file system."},
      "folder": {"reply": "When you open the game directory selector, you need to choose the folder your games are in, not the games themselves. Those will auto-populate. The only exception to this are .cia ROM files, which you'll need to install using `File>Install CIA...`"},
